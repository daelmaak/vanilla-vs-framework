## Pros

- Full control (obviously)
- Speed, minimal code (in small projects, can't judge big ones)
- Super nice callstack!
- You ship only what you need
- You can relatively easily implement lazy component loading, together with their styles!

## Cons

- Feels easier to create memory leaks
- Works only for smaller projects. In bigger projects, even if using only vanilla, some kind of framework has to be created to make the codebase, especially interaction with DOM, maintenable. This requires effort and planning and considerable experience to get stuff right.
- Takes a lot of time to figure out the best way to approach component composition beyond trivial projects
