## Pros:

- Very easy to code, very easy to setup with `create-react-app`
- Separation of DOM manipulation (which is itself already only declarative, not imperative as with vanillaJs) from the component logic
- Super easy to create component-based code splitting

## Cons:

- Not such a great flexibility in dealing with problems, which results in one having to get to know the framework better. This is luckily for the most part only a problem of RTFM.
- Much more code which needs to be downloaded
